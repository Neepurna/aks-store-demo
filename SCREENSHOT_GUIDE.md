## üéØ **Screenshot 4: Application Access**

### Option A: Port Forward Method
```bash
# 1. Port forward to store-front
kubectl port-forward svc/store-front 8080:80 -n aks-store-demo

# 2. In another terminal, test the connection
curl -I http://localhost:8080
```

### Option B: Direct Service Access
```bash
# 1. Get service details
kubectl describe svc store-front -n aks-store-demo

# 2. Show pod logs
kubectl logs -n aks-store-demo deployment/store-front --tail=10
```

**What to capture**: Working application access or service details.

---

## üéØ **Screenshot 5: Kubernetes Dashboard/Monitoring**

```bash
# 1. Show detailed pod information
kubectl describe pods -n aks-store-demo | head -50

# 2. Show resource usage (if metrics available)
kubectl top pods -n aks-store-demo || echo "Metrics not available"

# 3. Show namespaces
kubectl get namespaces
```

**What to capture**: Detailed pod information and resource usage.

---

## üéØ **Screenshot 6: Kustomize Configuration Files**

```bash
# 1. Show base kustomization
cat kustomize/base/kustomization.yaml

# 2. Show overlay configuration
cat kustomize/overlays/dev/kustomization.yaml

# 3. Show a sample manifest
cat kustomize/base/store-front.yaml
```

**What to capture**: The actual kustomize configuration files.

---

## üéØ **Screenshot 7: GitHub Integration**

### In your browser:
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to `.github/workflows/`
3. Show the workflow files created
4. Navigate to `kustomize/` directory
5. Show the kustomize structure

**What to capture**: GitHub repository showing the CI/CD pipeline and kustomize structure.

---

## üéØ **Screenshot 8: Application Working**

### Access the application:
```bash
# 1. Port forward to store-front
kubectl port-forward svc/store-front 8080:80 -n aks-store-demo &

# 2. Port forward to store-admin  
kubectl port-forward svc/store-admin 8081:80 -n aks-store-demo &

# 3. Test both applications
curl http://localhost:8080
curl http://localhost:8081
```

### In your browser:
1. Open `http://localhost:8080` (store-front)
2. Open `http://localhost:8081` (store-admin)

**What to capture**: Working web applications in browser.

---

## üéØ **Screenshot 9: Cleanup Process**

```bash
# 1. Show cleanup command
make kustomize-cleanup-dev

# 2. Verify cleanup
kubectl get all -n aks-store-demo

# 3. Show namespace deletion
kubectl get namespaces | grep aks-store
```

**What to capture**: Clean removal of all resources.

## üí° **Pro Tips for Screenshots:**

1. **Use full terminal** - Make sure all output is visible
2. **Include timestamps** - Shows when you did the work
3. **Show your username** - Proves it's your work
4. **Capture errors too** - Shows problem-solving skills
5. **Multiple angles** - Terminal, browser, GitHub, etc.
6. **Clear quality** - Make sure text is readable
